10 Naans:

- 1/4 cup warm water
- 2 Tsp granulated sugar
- 1.5 Tsp Active dry yeast (or rapid rise)
- 180ml Milk
- 180ml Plain Greek yogurt
- 4 Tbsp Vegetable oil (+ extra for cooking)

- 1 Tsp baking powder
- 1 Tsp salt

Garlic Butter:

- 3 Tbsp Butter

## Method

1. Combine the water, sugar and yeast. Let sit for 5-10 minutes or until the mixture begins to bubble on top.
2. Add in the milk, yogurt, oil, minced garlic, flour baking powder and salt, then mix together.
3. Use floured hands to knead the dough until smooth, about 3 to 5 minutes. (Or ideally use the bread maker setting)
4. Lightly grease a mixing bowl with cooking oil. Transfer dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. 
   Let rest at room temperature for about an hour until doubled in size.
5. When ready to cook, divide the dough into equal pieces on a flour-dusted board. 
6. With floured hands stretch the dough until about 6-inches long and 1/8-inch thick.
7. Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Grease skillet all over with 1/2 teaspoon of the extra oil.
8. Prepare the garlic butter by melting and combing the ingredients.
9. Place one piece of the naan on the oiled hot skillet and cook until bubbles form on top, about 1-2 minutes. 
10. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until large golden spots appear on the bottom.
11. Brush the naan with the garlic butter and repeat.
