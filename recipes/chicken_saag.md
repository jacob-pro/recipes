## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp Vegetable Oil
- 2 Large Onions
- 3 Tsp Minced Garlic
- 3 Tbsp Grated Fresh Ginger
- 2 Tsp Salt
- 2 Tsp Ground Coriander
- 2 Tsp Garam Masala
- 1.5 Tsp Ground Turmeric
- 1.5 Tsp Cumin
- 1 Tsp Ground Cardamom
- 1/2 Tsp Indian Chili Powder
- 2 Tbsp Tomato Paste
- 200ml Water
- 480g Baby Spinach
- 650g Chicken Breast
- 150g Natural Yoghurt.

## Method

1. Finely chop the onions, and grate the ginger.
2. Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, ginger, and garlic. Saute until softened
   for about 4-5 minutes.
3. Add the salt, coriander, garam masala, turmeric, cumin, cardamom, and chili powder, and stir on medium-low heat 
   until fragrant, about 30 seconds or so.
4. Dissolve the tomato paste in the water, then stir into the pan.
5. Add the spinach and stir to combine (in two batches if necessary). Cover and raise the heat to medium-high, 
   occasionally stirring until the spinach has begun to wilt (about 5 minutes).
6. Finish stirring the spinach until it is completely wilted but still bright green (about 1 minute).
7. Blend the spinach mix and then transfer to a bowl using a spatula.
8. Heat 1 Tbsp oil at medium-high heat in the pot, then add the diced chicken breast. Cook for about 7 minutes.
9. Pour the spinach mixture back into the pot and mix in, cook for another 2-3 minutes.
10. Stir in the yoghurt.
