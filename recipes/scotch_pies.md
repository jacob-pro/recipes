## Pastry

Requires small tins about 10cm in diameter.

For 2 Pies:

- 1 egg
- 1/2 Tsp Salt
- 150g plain flour
- 25g butter
- 25g lard
- 65ml water

For 4 Pies:

- 1 egg
- 300g plain flour
- 3/4 Tsp Salt
- 50g butter
- 50g lard
- 130ml water

For 6 Pies:

- 1 egg
- 1 Tsp Salt
- 450g plain flour
- 75g butter
- 75g lard
- 195ml water

### Method

1. Beat the egg and add to a bowl. Add the flour and salt, then make a well in the middle of the flour.
2. Cut the butter and lard into 1cm cubes. 
3. Add the water to a pan, and add the butter and lard, slowly heat but do not boil.
4. Once the fats are completely melted and mixed in bring to a boil then turn off the heat.
5. Add the fats to the bowl, and mix everything together with a spoon. Knead a little to make sure it's fully combined.
6. Quickly divide the pastry into a portion for each pie. Set aside a third of each portion for the lid. (Once the pastry has cooled it cannot be moulded).
7. Immediately form the pastry into the pie dishes, and shape a correct sized lid that will fit within the edges of the pastry walls.
8. Put the outer pastry in the fridge to harden.

## Filling

- 450g Lamb mince
- 2 Onions
- 2 Tsp Mixed herbs (typically basil, marjoram, and oregano. You could use rosemary as well).
- 1 Tsp Mace
- ~100ml Beef or Lamb stock

### Method

1. Finely chop the onion and fry in a pan. Add the mace and mixed herbs.
2. Transfer into a bowl with the stock. Mix in the lamb mince.
3. Add additional stock/gravy if necessary, but make sure the mixture isn't too wet.
4. Fill each of the pies with the mix, and then cover with the lid.
5. Cut a small hole in the top of the pies to let the air escape. 
6. Put the pies in the oven for around 45 minutes at 180Â°C
