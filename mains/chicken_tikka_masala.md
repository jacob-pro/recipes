## Method

1. Mix all the marinade ingredients together in a bowl. Add diced chicken and mix in. Marinate for 1-24 hours in the fridge.
2. Melt butter in a deep pot. Slowly fry the onion, sprinkle with a teaspoon of sugar, cook until soft
3. Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add garam masala, cumin, turmeric and coriander. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.
4. Pour in the passata, chili powders and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.
4. Meanwhile heat some oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. When sizzling add the chicken pieces (do not overcrowd the pan).
6. Fry the chicken until browned (about 3 mins each side), then set aside.
7. Stir the cream and 1 teaspoon of sugar through the sauce. Add the chicken and its juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. (Add some water if too thick)
8. Serve and garnish with coriander.
