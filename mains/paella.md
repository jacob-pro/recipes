## Ingredients

- Spanish Chorizo
- 50ml Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 1 Onion
- 1 Red Pepper
- 4 Cloves Garlic
- 227g Chopped Tomatoes
- Bay leaf
- Carmencita Paella Spice Mix (with Saffron)
- 60ml White Wine (or 2 Tbsp White Wine Vinegar)
- Chicken Thigh
- Fresh chopped parsley
- 1.5 Cups Paella Rice
- 1100ml Chicken Stock
- Seafood (Prawns, Mussels, Calamari, Scallops, etc.)

## Method

1. Chop the onion and pepper. Dice the chicken.
2. Cut the Chorizo into discs. Brown the sausage in hot oil and set aside.
3. Add olive oil to a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, bell peppers and crushed garlic and cook until onion 
   is translucent.
4. Add chopped tomato, bay leaf, and the spice mix. Stir and cook for 5 minutes. 
5. Add white wine and cook for 5 minutes. Add salt/pepper if needed.
6. Add chicken pieces, 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, chorizo, and rice to the pot. Cook for 1 minute.
7. Pour the broth slowly all around the pan and stir the pan to get the rice into an even layer. (Do not stir the mixture going forward!).
8. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low. Give the pan a gentle shake back and forth just once or twice during cooking. (Don't ever stir the rice, so that a socarrat forms at the bottom).
9. Cook for about 30 minutes (medium heat, uncovered), then nestle the seafood into the mixture, sprinkle peas on top and continue to cook (without stirring) for about 5 more minutes. Watch for most of the liquid to be absorbed and the rice at the top nearly tender. (If for some reason your rice is still not cooked, add Â¼ cup more water or broth and continue cooking).
10. Remove pan from heat and cover pan with a lid or tinfoil, allow to rest for 10 minutes.
11. Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon slices. Serve.
